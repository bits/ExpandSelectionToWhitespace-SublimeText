Expand the selection to touch up against the whitespace that surrounds the
cursor(s) or selection(s). Each selection is extended to (but not including) the
closest space, tab, newline, or Unicode spacing character around it.


	Windows and Linux: Ctrl+Shift+X
	Mac OS X:          Command+Shift+X


Usage
-----

	Quickly lazy-select text: Select partway into the first and last words and
	hit the shortcut.  This gives you much larger targets for the start and end
	of your selection, so you don't have to go slowly and precisely to get the
	pointer or cursor right at the tiny sweet spot.  It's surprising what a
	difference this makes.

	Paths: /home/user/project/awesome ← Place the cursor anywhere in the path
	        and get the whole thing with a keystroke

	Some coding styles: self.expand_region_to_whitespace(region)

	When you made a selection, but missed the first few characters — grab them
	instead of repeating yourself

	Selecting vertically aligned text or a column — Perform a narrow column
	selection (Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down on Windows/Linux, Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down on Mac) and
	widen each line's selection out to the whitespace with a flick of the
	fingers

	You'll find "Expand Selection to Whitespace" ready to do your bidding in the
	Selection menu, the Command Palette, and via key binding.


Use a different key binding
---------------------------

	The plugin supplies the `expand_selection_to_whitespace` command, which you
	can bind to your preferred keyboard shortcut in your `Preferences → Key
	Bindings – User` file by adding something like:

	{ "keys": ["ctrl+shift+x"], "command": "expand_selection_to_whitespace" }
